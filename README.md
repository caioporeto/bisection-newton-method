# bisection-newton-method
This repository contains code developed during my first year of Engineering studies at Poli USP. It integrates the Newton-Raphson method with the Bisection method to solve complex equations and find their rootsâ€”problems that calculators alone cannot solve.

If you use this code to solve some problems, remember to adjust max and min correctly. Read and understand the specifications below:

A value x is set to max only if f(x) is the maximum y-value obtained within the interval.
A value x is set to min only if f(x) is the minimum y-value obtained within the interval.
